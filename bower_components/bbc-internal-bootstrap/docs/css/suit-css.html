            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Suit is "an HTML/CSS framework for creating loosely coupled UI components". Full details can
            be found in <a href="https://github.com/suitcss/suit">the documentation</a>.</p>

            <p>For components developed specifically for BBC projects, the SUIT CSS framework and
            <a href="https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/STYLE.md">style guide</a> is used. This
            makes it simple for other developers to contribute and keeps the code base maintainable. Please
            familiarise yourself before using components or contributing.</p>

            <h3>Using with Bootstrap</h3>
            <p>SUIT CSS components can make use of Bootstrap in two ways. The best way is to use Bootstrap
            classes as a utility class:</h5>

{% highlight html %}
<div class="Component Component--modifier visible-xs visible-sm">
    <!-- Content -->
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>Alternatively, you can create a utility class that mixes in an existing Bootstrap class or
            mixin:</p>

{% highlight css %}
.u-someUtil {
    .btn;
    .btn-primary;
}{% endhighlight %}

            <p>The first option is preferred unless you need to add a lot of additional declarations to the rule set.</p>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p>The new Twitter profile pages make heavy use of SUIT CSS and serve as a good reference.</p>
