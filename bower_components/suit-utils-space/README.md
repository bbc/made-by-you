# SUIT utilities: space

A fork of the deprecated [suit-utils-space](https://github.com/suitcss/utils-space) package. This version just makes
use of the zero classes which are still useful in many cases.

Read more about [SUIT's design principles](https://github.com/necolas/suit/).

## Available classes

* `u-m<D>Z` - Margin zero in the direction `D`.
* `u-p<D>Z` - Padding zero in the direction `D`.
* `u-mAZ` - All directions zero on margin.

Where direction (`D`) can be:

* `A` - all
* `t` - top
* `r` - right
* `b` - bottom
* `l` - left
* `H` - horizontal
* `V` - vertical
